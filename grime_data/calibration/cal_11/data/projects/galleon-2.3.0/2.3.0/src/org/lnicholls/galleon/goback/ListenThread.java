 * Extracted from: TiVo Connect Automatic Machine Discovery Protocol Specification. Revision: 1.5.1, Last updated:

 *
 * Normally, UDP beacons are sent periodically to the broadcast address of the local network, on port 2190 (registered
 * to TiVo). Upon startup (meaning TiVo DVR boot up or activation of TiVo Connect software running on some other
 * hardware) a TCM broadcasts, for a short period of time (say, 30 seconds) a number of redundant packets in "high
 * frequency mode" (perhaps every 5 seconds). After this initial period, the TCM drops into "low frequency mode"
 * broadcasting at a reduced rate (maybe only once every minute). The initial high-frequency mode allows listeners
 * several chances to quickly detect TCMs that have just arrived, while the eventual low-frequency broadcasts should be
 * infrequent enough to not overly burden the network even in the presence of many TCMs. With broadcast-based discovery,
 * every TCM must be prepared to accept redundant packets, and should always assume they contain the latest information
 * about the originating TCM. Again, keep in mind that "connection-less" UDP beacons are sent blindly onto the network
 * with no guarantee that they'll ever be received. The periodic and redundant nature of the broadcastbased discovery
 * mechanism is necessary for it to work effectively.
