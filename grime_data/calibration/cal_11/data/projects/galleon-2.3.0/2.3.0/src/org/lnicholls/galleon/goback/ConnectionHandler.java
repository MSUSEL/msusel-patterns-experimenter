 * Extracted from: TiVo Connect Automatic Machine Discovery Protocol Specification. Revision: 1.5.1, Last updated:
 * 3/5/2003 Copyright ï¿½ 2003, TiVo Inc. All rights reserved The packet data format is common to all other aspects of the
 * protocol, while the broadcast-based and connection-based discovery mechanisms, although similar, each have their own
 * associated details. Every TCM must be prepared to participate in broadcast- and connection-based discovery
 * simultaneously. Regardless of the method used to transmit beacon packets, each participating TCM maintains an
 * internal list of all other TCMs from which it has heard. Records in this list are updated whenever new information
 * arrives. Records for TCMs that have not been heard from recently (or whose departures have been explicitly detected)
 * are eventually cycled off this list. In this way, whenever further communication is needed, the set of networked
 * machines able to "TiVo Connect", as well as their available services, can be known at any given moment with no need
 * to query the network.
