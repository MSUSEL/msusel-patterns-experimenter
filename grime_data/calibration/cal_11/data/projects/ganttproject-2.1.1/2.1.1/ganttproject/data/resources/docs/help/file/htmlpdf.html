<H3>GanttProject - HTML/PDF</H3>

Ganttproject can also export the project as HTML web pages. 
The different web pages contain all the information about the project:
<ul>
<li> Project information</li>
<li> The charts (Gantt and resources)</li>
<li> List of tasks with the different information like date of start/end, durations, notes...</li>
<li> List of resources</li>
</ul>

For HTML export GanttProject uses the XSL stylesheet to HTML transformation. <br>
GanttProject uses by default the XSL stylesheet included in the jar file.<br>
But you can specify another xsl stylesheet by selecting the directory containing it on the setting dialog.<br>
In fact you can create your own xsl stylesheet files to customize your html web pages.

<br><br>


For PDF export the software uses the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/fop">FOP</a> library
to export in pdf format. It also use the xsl transformation technology.<br>
So you can use PDF themes, and a default theme included in the GanttProject jar file.
