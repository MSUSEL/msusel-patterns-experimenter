<H3>GanttProject - Task creation</H3>

First, you create some tasks by using the <b>New Task</b> button or directly from the <b>Tasks</b> menu  choose New Task
The tasks appear on the tree on the left pane; you can directly change their name here.  
Next, you can organize tasks by indenting
them by groups or categories. So you could have a hierarchy like this:<br><br>

Tasks can also be re-organized by using the up and down functions. These functions move the selected task up or 
down in its hierarchy reordering it.
