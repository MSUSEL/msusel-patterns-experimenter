    <h1>Maven repository for Geotools binaries and dependencies</h1>
    
    <p align="justify">This directory contains <a href="http://www.geotools.org/">Geotools</a> binaries and
    some dependencies not found in the <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/maven2/">Ibiblio</a> public repository.
    This is a complement (not a replacement) for <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/maven2/">Ibiblio</a>. The
    directory layout is understood by <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven 2</a>, a project management
    tool used by the <a href="http://www.geotools.org/">Geotools</a> project. Geotools users are free to link
    their own project to this repository in order to get automatic downloads of Geotools binaries. A tutorial
    for doing so is provided <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOTOOLS/Using+the+SNAPSHOT+releases">there</a>.</p>
