/**
 * Represent a single connected component of a {@linkplain SurfaceBoundary surface boundary}.
 * It consists of a number of references to {@linkplain OrientableCurve orientable curves}
 * connected in a cycle (an object whose boundary is empty). A {@code Ring} is structurally
 * similar to a {@linkplain CompositeCurve composite curve} in that the end point of each
 * {@linkplain OrientableCurve orientable curve} in the sequence is the start point of the next
 * {@linkplain OrientableCurve orientable curve} in the sequence. Since the sequence is circular,
 * there is no exception to this rule. Each ring, like all boundaries is a cycle and each ring is
 * simple.
 * <p>
 * Even though each {@code Ring} is simple, the boundary need not be simple. The easiest
 * case of this is where one of the interior rings of a surface is tangent to its exterior ring.
 * Implementations may enforce stronger restrictions on the interaction of boundary elements.
