/**
 * Used to check geospatial information for integrity.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each ValidationPlugIn is very specific in nature: it performs one test
 * extermly well.  This simplifies design decisions, documenation
 * configuration and use.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Following the lead the excelent design work in the JUnit testing framework
 * validation results are collected by a ValidationResults object. This
 * interface for the ValidationResults object also allows it to collect
 * warning information.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The PlugIn is also required to supply some metadata to aid in its
 * deployment, scripting, logging and execution and error recovery:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * name: user's name of validation test
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * description: user's description of validation test
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * priority: used to schedule validation test
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * typeNames: used to connect validaiton test to transaction opperation
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Capabilities:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Uses FeatureResults to allow environment to gather error/warning information
 * as required (transaction XML document, JTable, logging system, etc...)
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Primiarly used as part of processing the Transaction opperation of a Web
 * Feature Server. Used to ensure that the DataStore is consistent before
 * commiting a Transaction.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
