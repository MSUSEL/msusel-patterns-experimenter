  {@linkplain org.geotools.referencing.crs.AbstractCRS Coordinate reference systems} implementation.
  An explanation for this package is provided in the {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.crs OpenGIS&reg; javadoc}.
  The remaining discussion on this page is specific to the Geotools implementation.

  <P ALIGN="justify">{@link org.geotools.referencing.crs.AbstractCRS} is the base class for all
  coordinate reference systems (CRS). CRS can have an arbitrary number of dimensions. Some are two-dimensional
  (e.g. {@link org.geotools.referencing.crs.DefaultGeographicCRS GeographicCRS} and
  {@link org.geotools.referencing.crs.DefaultProjectedCRS ProjectedCRS}), while some others are one-dimensional
  (e.g. {@link org.geotools.referencing.crs.DefaultVerticalCRS VerticalCRS} and
  {@link org.geotools.referencing.crs.DefaultTemporalCRS TemporalCRS}). Those simple coordinate systems can be
  used as building blocks for more complex coordinate reference systems. For example, it is possible to construct
  a three-dimensional CRS with (<var>latitude</var>, <var>longitude</var>, <var>time</var>) with an aggregation
  of {@link org.geotools.referencing.crs.DefaultGeographicCRS GeographicCRS} and
  {@link org.geotools.referencing.crs.DefaultTemporalCRS TemporalCRS}. Such aggregations
  are built with {@link org.geotools.referencing.crs.DefaultCompoundCRS CompoundCRS}.</P>
