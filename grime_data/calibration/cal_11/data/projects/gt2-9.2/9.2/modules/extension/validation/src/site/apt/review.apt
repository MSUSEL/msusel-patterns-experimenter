  STATUS: DIRTY
      Code is clean, 
      data dirty
        http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GEOT-1894
  
  
  
  validation.dto shema "probably needs a note" (see below)




* org.geotools.validation
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Outlines the validaiton framework and infrastructure.


* org.geotools.validation.attributes
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Attribute validaiton, aka what SQL is good at checking.


* org.geotools.validation.dto
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Beans use dto hold data enroute from xml to memory ...

    * schema probably needs a note


* org.geotools.validation.[network|relate|spatial]
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Remaining validation test, nothing that exciting.


* org.geotools.validation.xml
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


* org.geotools.validation.[attributes|relate] (test)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Bleah, the horribe memory leak test, the first brute force abuse of geotools
  datastore api.
