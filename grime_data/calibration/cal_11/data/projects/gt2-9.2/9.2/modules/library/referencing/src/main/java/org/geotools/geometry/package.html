  {@linkplain org.geotools.geometry.Geometry} implementation. An explanation for this
  package is provided in the {@linkplain org.opengis.spatialschema.geometry OpenGIS&reg;
  javadoc}. The remaining discussion on this page is specific to the Geotools implementation.

  <P ALIGN="justify">The {@link org.geotools.geometry.GeneralDirectPosition} class represents a
  point in a multi-dimensional space. This space may have an arbitrary number of dimensions. For
  a two-dimensional space, <CODE>DirectPosition</CODE> is conceptually equivalent to
  {@link java.awt.geom.Point2D}.</P>

  <P ALIGN="justify">The class {@link org.geotools.geometry.GeneralEnvelope} represents a box in
  a multi-dimensional space. For a two-dimensional space, <CODE>Envelope</CODE> is conceptually
  equivalent to {@link java.awt.geom.Rectangle2D}.</P>
