Reads 
GML files and translates them into Java objects.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="picture.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="410" height="640">Note that the final OGC simple geometry types used by these classes are the 
ones developed by Vivid Solutions as part of the Java Topology Suite.&nbsp; 
However, this not the only type of Java object that may be generated by using 
this suite of filters.&nbsp; For example, you could implement a 
GMLGeometryHandler to create custom geometry types or to store OGC simple types 
in your own custom format.&nbsp; The illustration shows how this works.</p>

<p><b>GMLDocumentFilter</b> reads in an arbitrary XML file, extracts all GML-namespace 
associate elements, and translates them into primitive geometry calls, handled 
by the GMLGeometryHandler.&nbsp; Essentially, GMLDocumentFilter handles all 
coordinate parsing so that handlers further down the chain never see any 
character data within GML objects.</p>

<p><b>GMLGeometryFilter</b> implements a GMLGeometryHandler and uses the 
SubHandlers to create finished JTS-based geometries.&nbsp; This is the only 
object that GMLGeometryFilter passes on down the chain from the GML namespace.&nbsp; 
All other XML is passed through without modification.</p>
