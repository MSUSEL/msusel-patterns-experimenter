/**
 * An implementation of GraphGenerator used to generate a graph representing a
 * directed line network. Graphs are generated by supplying the generator with 
 * objects of type LineSegment via the add(Object) method. <BR>
 * <BR>
 * For each line segment added, an edge in the graph is created. The builder
 * records the end coordinates of each line added, and maintains a map of 
 * coordinates to nodes, creating nodes when neccessary.<BR>
 * <BR>
 * Edges created by the generator are of type BasicDirectedEdge and contain an 
 * object of type LineSegment.<BR>
 * Nodes created by the generator are of type BasicDirectedXYNode and contain 
 * an object of type Coordinate.
