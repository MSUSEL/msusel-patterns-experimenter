  <BODY>
  {@linkplain org.geotools.referencing.AbstractReferenceSystem Reference systems} implementation. An
  explanation for this package is provided in the {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing OpenGIS&reg; javadoc}.
  The remaining discussion on this page is specific to the Geotools implementation.

  <P ALIGN="justify">This package provides implementations for general positioning, coordinate
  reference systems (CRS), and coordinate transformations. Coordinates can have any number of
  dimensions. So this implementation can handle 2D and 3D coordinates, as well as 4D, 5D,
  <CITE>etc.</CITE></P>
  
  <P ALIGN="justify">This package provides a special implementation of
  {@linkplain org.geotools.referencing.NamedIdentifier identifier}, which is also a
  {@linkplain org.opengis.util.GenericName generic name}. By implementing those two
  interfaces, it is possible to use the same kind of object for specifying both the
  {@linkplain org.geotools.referencing.AbstractIdentifiedObject#getName main identifier} and the
  {@linkplain org.geotools.referencing.AbstractIdentifiedObject#getAlias aliases} of an
  {@linkplain org.geotools.referencing.AbstractIdentifiedObject identified object}.</P>
  
  <P ALIGN="justify">All factory methods are capable to find an object using an
  unscoped (or local) name. However, in order to avoid potential conflict, it is
  recommanded to use scoped name when possible. For example even if both can work,
  prefer "EPSG:9624" instead of "9624" for the affine transform in order to avoid
  potential conflict with an other authority using the same code number.</P>
  
  <H3>Command-line tools</H3>
  <P ALIGN="justify">A set of command lines tools is provided for performing queries.
  The tools are implemented in the <CODE>main</CODE> method of some key classes. The
  tools are:</P>
