<body>

Geometry based Validation implementations.
<p>
This package is used to store simple Geometry based
Validation implementations. Many of these will be simple 
FeatureValidation implementations concerned with limiting
the defaultGeometry of a Feature.
</p>
<p>
At least a couple IntegrityValidation tests will also be implemented here
performing such opperations as ensuring the defaultGeometries do not overlap
for an entire FeatureType.
</p>
<p>
The constraints represented by many of these Validation checks are designed to
provide similar coverage to the ArcSDE GeoDatabase appliaction.
Where possible we have followed a similar naming convention to the ESRI product.
