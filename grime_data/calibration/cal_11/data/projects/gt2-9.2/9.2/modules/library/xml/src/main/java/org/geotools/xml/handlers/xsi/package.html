<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This package contains information about xml schemas, and processes to create 
parse and interpret Schema. One of the more important function is the 
simplification of a Schema into the interface in the xsi package, as well as 
compressing some of the heirarchy. </p>
<p>These classes should be used by assessing the SchemaFactory.</p>
<h2>Future Work / Caveat</h2>
<p>Work can be completed on two fronts, improving the compression algorithms 
for the Schema compression. The second major work for this schema should be to 
encode the Schema parsing (this package) as a Schema Object, using the document 
parser to complete the same task through an xsi extension. </p>
<p>Although it was evident early on that these tasks were similar, the exact 
nature and method of bootstrapping the process was not evident. Converting 
these classes to a Schema definition similar to GML would simplify the code, 
making it easier to maintain.</p>
