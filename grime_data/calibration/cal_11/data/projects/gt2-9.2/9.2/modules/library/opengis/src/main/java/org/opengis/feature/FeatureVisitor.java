 * FeatureVisitor interface to allow for container optimised traversal.

 * visitor we allow the implementor of a Feature Collection to make use of
 * additional resources (such as multiple processors or tiled data)

 * This interface is most often used for calculations and data
 * transformations and an implementations may intercept known visitors
 * (such as "bounds" or reprojection) and engage an alternate work flow.
