/**
 * A two- or three-dimensional coordinate system that consists of any combination of coordinate
 * axes not covered by any other Coordinate System type. An example is a multilinear coordinate
 * system which contains one coordinate axis that may have any 1-D shape which has no intersections
 * with itself. This non-straight axis is supplemented by one or two straight axes to complete a 2
 * or 3 dimensional coordinate system. The non-straight axis is typically incrementally straight or
 * curved. A {@code UserDefinedCS} shall have two or three
 * {@linkplain #getAxis axis associations}.
