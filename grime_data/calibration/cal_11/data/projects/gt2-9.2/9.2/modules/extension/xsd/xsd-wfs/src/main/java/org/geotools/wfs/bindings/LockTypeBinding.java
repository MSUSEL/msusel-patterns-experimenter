/**
 * Binding object for the type http://www.opengis.net/wfs:LockType.

 *        <pre>
 *         <code>
 *  &lt;xsd:complexType name="LockType"&gt;
 *      &lt;xsd:annotation&gt;
 *          &lt;xsd:documentation&gt;
 *              This type defines the Lock element.  The Lock element
 *              defines a locking operation on feature instances of
 *              a single type. An OGC Filter is used to constrain the
 *              scope of the operation.  Features to be locked can be
 *              identified individually by using their feature identifier
 *              or they can be locked by satisfying the spatial and
 *              non-spatial constraints defined in the filter.
 *           &lt;/xsd:documentation&gt;
 *      &lt;/xsd:annotation&gt;
 *      &lt;xsd:sequence&gt;
 *          &lt;xsd:element maxOccurs="1" minOccurs="0" ref="ogc:Filter"/&gt;
 *      &lt;/xsd:sequence&gt;
 *      &lt;xsd:attribute name="handle" type="xsd:string" use="optional"&gt;
 *          &lt;xsd:annotation&gt;
 *              &lt;xsd:documentation&gt;
 *                 The handle attribute allows a client application
 *                 to assign a client-generated request identifier
 *                 to a Lock action.  The handle is included to
 *                 facilitate error reporting.  If one of a set of
 *                 Lock actions failed while processing a LockFeature
 *                 request, a WFS may report the handle in an exception
 *                 report to localize the error.  If a handle is not
 *                 present then a WFS may employ some other means of
 *                 localizing the error (e.g. line number).
 *              &lt;/xsd:documentation&gt;
 *          &lt;/xsd:annotation&gt;
 *      &lt;/xsd:attribute&gt;
 *      &lt;xsd:attribute name="typeName" type="xsd:QName" use="required"&gt;
 *          &lt;xsd:annotation&gt;
 *              &lt;xsd:documentation&gt;
 *                The value of the typeName attribute is the name
 *                of the feature type to be updated. The name
 *                specified must be a valid type that belongs to
 *                the feature content as defined by the GML
 *                Application Schema.
 *             &lt;/xsd:documentation&gt;
 *          &lt;/xsd:annotation&gt;
 *      &lt;/xsd:attribute&gt;
 *  &lt;/xsd:complexType&gt;
