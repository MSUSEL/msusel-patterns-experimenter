 * A {@linkplain Complex complex} with all the geometric properties of a surface. Thus, this

 * Essentially, a composite surface is a collection of oriented surfaces that join in pairs on
 * common boundary curves and which, when considered as a whole, form a single surface.

 *       of some set theoretic operation. Specifically, {@code Primitive.contains(...)}
 *       (returns FALSE for end points) is different from {@code Complex.contains(...)}
 *       (returns TRUE for end points).
