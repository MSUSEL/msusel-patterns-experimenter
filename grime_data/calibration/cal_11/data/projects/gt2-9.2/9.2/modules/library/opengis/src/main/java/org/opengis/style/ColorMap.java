/**
 * <p>The ColorMap element defines the mapping of palette-type raster colors or fixed-
 * numeric pixel values to colors using an Interpolate or Categorize SE function
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, a DEM raster giving elevations in meters above sea level can be
 * translated to a colored  image with a ColorMap.  The quantity attributes of
 * a color-map are used for translating between numeric  matrixes and color
 * rasters and the ColorMap entries should be in order of increasing numeric
 * quantity so  that intermediate numeric values can be matched to a color (or
 * be interpolated between two colors).   Labels may be used for legends or
 * may be used in the future to match character values.   Not all systems can
 * support opacity in colormaps.  The default opacity is 1.0 (fully opaque).
 * Defaults for quantity and label are system-dependent.
