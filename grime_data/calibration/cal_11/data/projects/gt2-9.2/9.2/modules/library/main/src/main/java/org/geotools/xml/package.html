Package supporting XML parsing with a focus on GML.

<p>The package supports GML version 2.X defined at <a 
href="http://www.opengis.net/gml/">http://www.opengis.net/gml/</a>. 
Although the schema and instance parsers appearing in this package 
can be extended for use in most xml applications, the package was 
intended to be used as a starting point to parse GML 2.0 documents. 
</p>

<p>
For simplistic parsing requirements, you should refer to the 'Basics' 
portion of this document. For more complex parsing requirements, or 
optimizations you should also read 'Extending the Parser'.
</p>

<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>
This set of parsers (one xsi + one xml) is intended to parse arbitrary 
schema defined xml documents. This means that the XML document must 
have namespace definitions for the document, although there may be one 
default namespace defined within the document.
</p>
<p>
When asked to parse an XML instance document, the parser will first defer 
to another instance to create a Schema instance of the document requested. 
In some cases the entire Schema, or portions of the Schema, may already be 
parsed and reside in a cahce. In this case the Schema will not be parsed, 
otherwise a new instance of the Schema requested will be created and stored. 
The Schema is important because it is used in the parsing and validation of 
the XML document.
</p>
<p>
To complete basic parsing, use the DocumentFactory.getInstance(URI) method. 
This will return an Object representing the document (undefined ComplexTypes 
are Object[], simpleTypes are their type parsed ... int is an Integer). In some 
cases, specific pre-defined namespaces will not return Object[] for complexTypes 
(such as gml elements, and gml-inherited elements). 
</p>
<h2>Extending the Parser</h2>
<p>Parser extensions should be completed for two reasons: either you want it to 
go faster, or you want specific types to parse information in a specific manner. 
In either case you should construct a Schema instance, and add it to the 
SchemaFactory.properties file found in this package. You will note that you will 
be required to implement any ComplexTypes which are included in your schema, as 
such providing an opportunity [getValue(Element,ElementValue[],Attributes)] to 
create your own parsed values. 
</p>
<p>The framework will automatically get all you 
children's values and place then in the order parsed into the ElementValue[]. 
This means that each type is only responsible for interpreting it's own data, 
removing the need for recursion. Please be careful or unwanted resources staying 
in memory, as memory usage can grow quickly. I should also note that I make no 
claims as to Thread safety, and as such you may wish to consider this when 
creating an extension implementation.
</p>
<p>
For more information study the interfaces found in the org.geotools.xml.schema 
package, and an example hardcoded Schema, look in org.geotools.xml.gml . 
</p>
<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>
Some of the code and design within this package was first though of by Ian 
Schneider. Much of the remaining design and implementation was completed by 
David Zwiers.
