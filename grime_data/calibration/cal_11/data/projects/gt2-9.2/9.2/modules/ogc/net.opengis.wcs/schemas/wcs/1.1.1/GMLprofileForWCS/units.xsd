			<documentation>Reference to a unit of measure definition that applies to all the numerical values described by the element containing this element. Notice that a complexType which needs to include the uom attribute can do so by extending this complexType. Alternately, this complexType can be used as a pattern for a new complexType.</documentation>

				<documentation>Reference to a unit of measure definition, usually within the same XML document but possibly outside the XML document which contains this reference. For a reference within the same XML document, the "#" symbol should be used, followed by a text abbreviation of the unit name. However, the "#" symbol may be optional, and still may be interpreted as a reference.</documentation>
