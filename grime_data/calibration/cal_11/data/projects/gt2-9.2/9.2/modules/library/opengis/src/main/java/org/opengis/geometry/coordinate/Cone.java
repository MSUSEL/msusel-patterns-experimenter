/**
 * A {@linkplain GriddedSurface gridded surface} given as a family of conic sections whose
 * {@linkplain #getControlPoints control points} vary linearly. A 5-point ellipse with all
 * defining positions identical is a point. Thus, a truncated elliptical cone can be given
 * as a 2&times;5 set of control points
 *
 * &lt;&lt;P1, P1, P1, P1, P1&gt;, &lt;P2, P3, P4, P5, P6&gt;&gt;.
 *
 * P1 is the apex of the cone. P2, P3, P4, P5, and P6 are any five distinct points around
 * the base ellipse of the cone. If the horizontal curves are circles as opposed to ellipses,
 * then a circular cone can be constructed using &lt;&lt;P1, P1, P1&gt;, &lt;P2, P3, P4&gt;&gt;.
