  A set of base types from ISO 19103 which can not be mapped directly from Java, plus utilities.

  <h3>Names and Namespaces</h3>
  <p align="justify">The job of a "name" in the context of ISO 19103 is to associate that name
  with an {@link java.lang.Object}.  Examples given are <cite>objects</cite>: which form namespaces
  for their attributes, and <cite>Schema</cite>: which form namespaces for their components.
  A straightforward and natural use of the namespace structure defined in 19103 is the translation
  of given names into specific storage formats.  XML has different naming rules than shapefiles,
  and both are different than NetCDF.  This common framework can easily be harnessed to impose
  constraints specific to a particular application without requiring that a separate implementation
  of namespaces be provided for each format.</p>

  <h3>Records and Schemas</h3>
  <p align="justify">Records and Schemas are similar to a {@code struct} in C/C++, a table in SQL,
  a {@code RECORD} in Pascal, or an attribute-only class in Java if it were stripped of all notions
  of inheritance.  They are organized into named collections called Schemas. Both records and schemas
  behave as dictionaries for their members and are similar to "packages" in Java.</p>
