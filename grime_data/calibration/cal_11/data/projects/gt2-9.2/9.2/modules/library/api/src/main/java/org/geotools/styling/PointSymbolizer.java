/**
 * A symbolizer describes how a feature should appear on a map.
 *
 * <p>
 * The symbolizer defines not just the shape that should appear but also  such
 * graphical properties as color and opacity.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A symbolizer is obtained by specifying one of a small number of different
 * types of symbolizer and then supplying parameters to overide its default
 * behaviour.
