 *   ISO 19111 defines {@code Position} like a C/C++ {@code union} of {@code DirectPosition} and
 *   {@code Point}. Since unions are not allowed in Java, GeoAPI defines {@code Position} as the
 *   base interface of the above. This leads to a slightly different semantic since ISO defines
 *   {@link #getDirectPosition} as conditional, while GeoAPI defines it as mandatory by allowing
 *   the method to return {@code this}.
