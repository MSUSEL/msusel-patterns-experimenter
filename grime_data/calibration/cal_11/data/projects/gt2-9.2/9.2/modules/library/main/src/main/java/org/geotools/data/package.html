  Defines the DataStoreAPI via which all data is imported or exported.
<p>
  All DataStores (e.g. PostGIS, Shapefile(tm), GML...) must provide
implementations of the DataStore interface and the DataStoreFactorySpi
interface.  These interfaces allow new types of datastore to be plugged into
applications which use geotools without the need to modify any code.
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre>
<code>
FeatureStore postgis = new PostGisDataStore( ... );
Query all = Query.ALL;
FeatureType roadType = postgis.getFeatureType( "roads" );

// reader 1 streams over all roads
FeatureReader reader1 = postgis.getFeatureReader( roadsType, all, Transaction.AUTO_COMMIT );

// allRoads = featureResults is a prepaired query of all roads
FeatureSource roads = postgis.getFeatureSource( "roads" );
FeatureResults allRoads = roads.getFeatures( all );

// reader 2 & 3 streams over all roads in the same manner as reader 1
FeatureReader reader2 = allRoads.reader();
FeatureReader reader3 = allRoads.reader();

// bounds1 returns the bounding box of roads, may be null depending on expense
Envelope bounds1 = roads.getBounds( all );

// bounds2 returns the bounding box of roads, may actually calculate by going over the entire dataset
Envelope bounds 2 = allRoads.getBounds();
