This is the readme file for the ArcSDE DataStore of the geotools2 project.

This module is out of the normal build since we can't provide the required
libraries from ESRI to access an ArcSDE database through Java. 
If you intend to use this module and have access to the 
ESRI's ArcSDE Java API libraries (for instance jpe90_sdk.jar and
jsde90_sdk.jar) the easiest way of getting the module building is adding
them to your JRE's ext/lib directory and uncomment this module from the 
list of excludes in the root project maven pom.xml



Unit testing the ArcSDE DataSource over a live database is disabled
due to the lack of a publicly available one.

If you have a live ArcSDE database and want to run the
unit tests over it, remove or comment the line
<exclude>**/SdeDataStoreTest.java</exclude>
on project.xml and see tests/unit/testData/testparams.properties
for instructions on setting up testing and connection options.

For any comment, suggestion or contribution to this code,
email to the geotools-devel@sourceforge.net mailing list
or contact me directly at groldan@users.sourceforge.net
