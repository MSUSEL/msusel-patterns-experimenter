  </HEAD>
  <BODY>
  Root package for various metadata implementations. This root package is not
  linked to any particular metadata standard. It assumes that a standard is
  defined through a set of Java interfaces (for example {@link org.opengis.metadata})
  and uses reflection for performing basic operations like comparaisons and copies.
  <p>
  Possible metadata implementations (already available or planed in a future
  Geotools version) are:
  <UL>
    <LI><P>{@link org.geotools.metadata.iso}: concrete implementation of ISO
        interfaces, including ISO 19115.</P></LI>
    <LI><P>{@code org.geotools.metadata.dublin}: concrete implementation of
        Dublin core interfaces. <EM>Not yet implemented.</EM></P></LI>
    <LI><P>{@link org.geotools.metadata.sql}: implementation of metadata interfaces
        backed by a SQL database. The metadata interfaces doesn't need to be ISO ones,
        which is why this package is not a sub-package of the ISO's one.</P></LI>
    <LI><P>{@code org.geotools.metadata.xml}: implementation of metadata interfaces
        backed by a XML files. The metadata interfaces doesn't need to be ISO ones,
        which is why this package is not a sub-package of the ISO's one.
        <EM>Not yet implemented.</EM></P></LI>
