test mapping files, and related files in test-data are the original work of GeoTools
contributors whose copyright has been assigned to OSGeo; these are licensed under the

Exceptions:

Except as noted below, test-data/commonSchemas and test-data/commonSchemas_new contain versions of various
OGC schemas. These are used under the OGC Software Notice license.

test-data/commonSchemas/XMML contains a version of XMML, used under the CSIRO Software Notice license.

test-data/commonSchemas/geosciml and test-data/commonSchemas_new/GeoSciML contain versions of GeoSciML,
copyright the Commission for the Management and Application of Geoscience Information (CGI),
a commission of the International Union of Geological Sciences.

test-data/commonSchemas_new/*.xsd (awdip.xsd, WaterML.xsd, SampleSite.xsd, ObservationProfiles.xsd) were
likely added by Rob Atkinson (CSIRO Land and Water) in support of AWDIP GeoServer work. Rob is a
contributor; copyright on these schemas has not yet been confirmed.

test-data/commonSchemas_new/mineralOccurrence and test-data/commonSchemas_new/earthresourceml are
