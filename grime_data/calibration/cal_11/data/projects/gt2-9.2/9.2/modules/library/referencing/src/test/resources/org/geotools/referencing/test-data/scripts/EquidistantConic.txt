// Test points for the Equidistant Conic projection
//
// (C) 2004-2008, Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo)
//
// The following test points were calculated with libproj4 utility "cs2cs" 
//
// Andrea Aime - Nov 22 2009

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------
// How to run this script:
//
//    chdir org/geotools/referencing/test-data/scripts
//    java -ea org.geotools.referencing.ScriptRunner EquidistantConic.txt
//
// A test is performed every time a "target pt" statement occurs. If the target point computed
// by Geotools is different from the target point declared in this script by an amount greater
// than the value specified in the last "test tolerance" statement, then a failure is reported.
// Inverse transforms are tested if java assertions are enabled.
// If some test fails, "print" statements can be added in this script for debugging purpose:
//
//    print crs            (prints the source and target CRS, and the transform between them)
//    print pts            (prints the source and target points, and their transformed points)


// CRS used for the test
