DataStore implementation for the ArcSDE 8.x and 9.x spatial gateway.
<p>This implementation is based on the <a
	href="http://edndoc.esri.com/arcsde/9.1/java_api/docs/index.html">ESRI
ArcSDE Java API</a>. This API is based on a single jar file which maven
downloads automatically and a couple of platform specific libraries
(.dll or .so). So we have made an effort in order to this DataStore
implementation not being dependent of those native libraries.</p>
<p>The feature set of the ArcSDEDataStore includes feature write
support but is actually limited to the in-process locking manager. Native
locking should be developed and will be highly appreciated, so volunteers
are wellcome.</p>
