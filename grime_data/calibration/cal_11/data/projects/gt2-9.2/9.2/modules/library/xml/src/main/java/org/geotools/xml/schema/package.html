<h1>Schema Interfaces</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This package is intended to provide all the necessary interfaces to semantically 
represent an XML Schema. Some of the concious shortcomings of this interface set 
include the in-ability to reproduce exact xml schema documents from a schema 
represented in memory using just these interfaces (some non-essential constructs 
have been removed/ignored). </p>
<p>Implementors creating instances of this package should refer to the SchemaFactory 
(org.geotools.gml) to link your implmentation into the parser.</p>

<h2>How to make an extension</h2>
<p>This is easy to describe, but hard to implement (or rather to test + debug). 
Essentially you should create a class that implements Schema, and register it 
with the SchemaFactory. When creating the appropriate Types as part of the 
Schema (I assume your Schema will have these) you can link extra parsing into 
the getValue method (see Type Interface).</p>
