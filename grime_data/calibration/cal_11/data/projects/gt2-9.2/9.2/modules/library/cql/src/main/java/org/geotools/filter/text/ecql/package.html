    <H3>Implementation and Design Notes</H3>

    <P ALIGN="justify">
    The <b>ECQL</b> class is the interface of this module. It provides access to all functionalities of the ECQL parser. 
    </P>

    <P ALIGN="justify">
    The parser was generated using <A HREF="https://javacc.dev.java.net/">javacc</A>. 
    In ECQLGrammar.jjt file you can see the input grammar for <b>javacc</b> that is required to parse the ECQL syntax rules. The generated
    class are allocated in the <b>org.geotools.filter.text.generated.parsers</b> package, these classes are not
    part of the module interface, then the client module shouldn't use them.
    </P>
    
    <P ALIGN="justify">
    The <b>org.geotools.filter.text.commons</b> package encapsulate classes intended as commons utilities used
    in the ECQL and CQL parsing process. They are not utilities for client modules, they are part of the cql module
    implementation, so client module shouldn't use them.   
    </P>
