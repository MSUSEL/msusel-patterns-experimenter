<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This package provides the necessary tools to parse an XML instance document 
using the XMLSAXHandler and DocumentFactory. As the document is parsed, and 
validated, an instance of the ElementHandlerFactory will gather a collection of 
valid namespaces for the instance document. The ElementHandlerFactory will then 
use this information to create Complex and Simple Element handlers. 
</p><p>
On occation, generic valid data may exist, but that we are unable to fully parse. 
This content will be ignored using the IgnoreHandler. 
</p><p>
The Document Handler is used by the XMLSAXHandler to bootstrap the process of 
importing schemas and creating handlers.</p>
