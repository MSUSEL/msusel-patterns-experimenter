    * (C) 2003, 2ie Technologie

  2ie Technologie do not exists anymore. Their work were very closely
  related to "Institut de Recherche pour le D�veloppement" (IRD). Actually, IRD was the
  funder if I remember right. I wonder if we could remove this last copyright...
  (actually merge it with the "Institut de Recherche pour le Développement" copyright,
  which I believe is close to what the situation really was).
