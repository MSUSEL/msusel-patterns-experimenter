     ANT BUILD FILE (Ref. http://jakarta.apache.org/ant )

     Ant script preparing SQL scripts for HSQL. The scripts provided by EPSG
     can't be run "as is" because of minor SQL language differences. Some
     keywords must be replaced, and the date format must be changed from
     "yyyy/mm/dd" to "yyyy-mm-dd". This scripts performs those changes in a
     copy of EPSG scripts.

     There is one change that this script doesn't performs. Column creation
     in the form "columnName UNIQUE" must move the "unique" keyword at the
     end of table creation in the form "UNIQUE (columnName)". This change
     needs to be done by hand in the "EPSG_Tables.sql" file.

     The SQL scripts must be executed in the following order:

         EPSG_Tables.sql
         EPSG_Data.sql
         EPSG_FKeys.sql
