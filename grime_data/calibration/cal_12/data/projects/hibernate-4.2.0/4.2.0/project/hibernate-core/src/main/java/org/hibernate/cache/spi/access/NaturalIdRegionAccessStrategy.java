 * Note the special case of <b>UPDATES</b> above.  Because the cache key itself has changed here we need to remove the

 * There is another usage pattern that is used to invalidate entries
 * after performing "bulk" HQL/SQL operations:
 * {@link #lockRegion} -> {@link #removeAll} -> {@link #unlockRegion}
