  Demonstrates the use of property-ref to map legacy data where
  foreign keys reference something other than the primary key of
  the associated entity. Here we show:
  
  (1) A one-to-one foreign key association (prefer primary key 
      associations)
      
  (2) A bidirectional one-to-many association on a key that is
      comprised of several properties of the associated entity
