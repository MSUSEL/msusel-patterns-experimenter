<!--
    Demonstrates mapping an "optional" one-to-one association.  Basically
    a (zero or one)-to-one.

    Note that this is only conceptually possible on the non-constrained
    side of the association (the side without the FK).

    Also, it is impossible that the optional side be lazy; we must hit the
    target table to determine whether a matching row actually exists or not.
    This is so we can properly determine whether to use null or some value
    for the association property's value.
