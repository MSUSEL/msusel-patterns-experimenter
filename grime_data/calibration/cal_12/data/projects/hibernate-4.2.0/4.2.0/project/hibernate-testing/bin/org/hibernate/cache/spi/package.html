            Defines the Hibernate second level caching SPI.
        </p>
        <p>
            The initial contract here is {@link org.hibernate.cache.spi.RegionFactory} whose implementations are
            responsible for configuring and managing lifecycle operations in regards to the particular underlying
            caching library.  Its other main purpose is to build specializations {@link org.hibernate.cache.spi.Region}
            instances based on the type of data we will be storing in that given region.
