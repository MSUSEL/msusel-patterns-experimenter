1.0 Introduction
Heritrix is the Internet Archive's open-source, extensible, web-scale,
archival-quality web crawler project. Heritrix (sometimes spelled heretrix, or
misspelled or missaid as heratrix/heritix/heretix/heratix) is an archaic word
for heiress (woman who inherits). Since our crawler seeks to collect and
preserve the digital artifacts of our culture for the benefit of future
researchers and generations, this name seemed apt.


2.0 Webmasters!
Heritrix is designed to respect the robots.txt 
<http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/robots.html> exclusion directives and META robots
tags <http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/exclusion.html#meta>. If you notice our
crawler behaving poorly, please send us email at archive-crawler-agent *at*
lists *dot* sourceforge *dot* net.
