Provides classes for a simple decision rules framework.

<p>Each 'step' in a decision rule set which can
affect an objects ultimate fate is called a <code>DecideRule</code>.
Each DecideRule renders a decision (possibly neutral) on the
passed objects fate.</p>

<p>Possible decisions are:
<ul>
  <li>ACCEPT means the object is ruled-in for further processing</li>
  <li>REJECT means the object is ruled-out for further processing</li>
  <li>PASS means this particular DecideRule has no opinion</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>As previously outlined, each DecideRule is applied in turn;
the last one to express a non-PASS preference wins.</p>

<p>For example, if the rules are:
<ul><li>AcceptDecideRule -- ACCEPTs all (establishing a default)</li>
<li>TooManyHopsDecideRule(max-hops=3) -- REJECTS all with
      hopsPath.length()>3, PASSes otherwise</li>
<li>PrerequisiteAcceptDecideRule -- ACCEPTs any with 'P' as
      last hop, PASSes otherwise (this allows 'LLL's which
      need a 'LLLP' prerequisite a chance to complete)</li>
</ul>
Then, you have a crawl that will go 3 hops (of any type)
from the seeds, with a special affordance to get prerequisites
 of 3-hop items (which may be 4 "hops" out)</p>
   
<p>To allow this style of decision processing to be plugged into the
   existing Filter and Scope slots:
<ul><li>There's a DecidingFilter which takes an (ordered) map of
     DecideRules</li>
<li>There's a DecidingScope which takes the same</li>
</ul>
</p>

for background.</p>
