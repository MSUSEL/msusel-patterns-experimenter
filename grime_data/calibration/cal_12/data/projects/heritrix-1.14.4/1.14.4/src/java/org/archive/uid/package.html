<body>
A unique ID generator.
Default is {@link org.archive.uid.UUIDGenerator}.  
To use another ID Generator, set the System Property
<code>org.archive.uid.GeneratorFactory.generator</code> to point
at an alternate implementation of {@link org.archive.uid.Generator}.

<h2>TODO</h2>
<ul>
    <li>MIME boundaries have upper-bound of 70 characters total including
    'blank line' (<code>CRLFCRLF</code>) and two leading hyphens. Add to
    {@link org.archive.uid.Generator} 
    interface an upper-bound on generated ID length.</li>
<li>Add example of an <i>actionable</i> uid generator:
e.g. <code>http://archive.org/UID-SCHEME/ID</code>
where scheme might be <code>UUID</code> and an ID might be
<code>f9472055-fbb6-4810-90e8-68fd39e145a6;type=metadata</code> or,
using <a href="http://ark.cdlib.org/arkcdl.pdf">ARK</a>: 
<code>http://archive.org/ark:/13030/f9472055-fbb6-4810-90e8-68fd39e145a6;type=metadata</code>.
