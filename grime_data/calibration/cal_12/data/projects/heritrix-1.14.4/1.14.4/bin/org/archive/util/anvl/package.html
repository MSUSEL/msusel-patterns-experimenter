Parsers and Writers for the (expired) Internet-Draft <a 
href="http://www.cdlib.org/inside/diglib/ark/anvlspec.pdf">A Name-Value
Language (ANVL)</a>.  Use {@link org.archive.util.anvl.ANVLRecord} 
to create new instances of ANVL Records and for parsing.

<h2>Implementation Details</h2>
<p>The ANVL Internet-Draft of 14 February, 2005 is inspecific as to the
definition of 'blank line' and 'newline'.  This parser implementation
assumes <code>CRNL</code>.
</p>
<p>Says "An element consists of a label, a colon, and an optional value".
Should that be: "An element consists of a label and an optional value, or a
comment."</p>

<p>Specification is unclear regards CR or NL in <i>label</i> or 
<i>comment</i> (This implementation disallows CR or NL in labels but lets
them pass in comments).</p>

<p>A grammar would help.  Here is RFC822:
<pre>
     field       =  field-name ":" [ field-body ] CRLF
     
     field-name  =  1*&lt;any CHAR, excluding CTLs, SPACE, and ":"&gt;
     
     field-body  =  field-body-contents
                    [CRLF LWSP-char field-body]
     
     field-body-contents =
                   &lt;the ASCII characters making up the field-body, as
                    defined in the following sections, and consisting
                    of combinations of atom, quoted-string, and
                    specials tokens, or else consisting of texts&gt;
</pre>
