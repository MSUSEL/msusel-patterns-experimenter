<title>org.archive.io.warc package</title>
</head>
<body>
Experimental WARC Writer and Readers.  Code and specification subject to change
with no guarantees of backward compatibility: i.e. newer readers
may not be able to parse WARCs written with older writers. This package
contains prototyping code for revision 0.12 of the WARC specification.
See <a href="https://archive-access.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/archive-access/branches/gjm_warc_0_12/warc/warc_file_format.html">latest revision</a>
for current state (Version 0.10 code and its documentation has been moved into the
<a href="v10/package.html">v10</a> subpackage).


<h2>Implementation Notes</h2>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>Initial implementations of <code>Arc2Warc</code> and <code>Warc2Arc</code>
tools can be found in the package above this one, at
{@link org.archive.io.Arc2Warc} and {@link org.archive.io.Warc2Arc}
respectively.  Pass <code>--help</code> to learn how to use each tool.
</p>

<h2>TODO</h2>
<ul>
<li>Is MIME-Version header needed?  MIME Parsers seem fine without (python email
lib and java mail).</li>
<li>Should we write out a Content-Transfer-Encoding
header (Currently we do not). Need section in spec. explicit about our
interpretation of MIME and deviations (e.g. content-transfer-encoding should
be assumed binary in case of WARCs, multipart is not disallowed but not
encouraged, etc.)</li>
<li>Minor: Do WARC-Version: 0.12 like MIME-Version: 1.0 rather than 
WARC/0.12 for lead in to an ARCRecord?</li>
</ul>
