<property>
  <name>mapred.queue.default.acl-submit-job</name>
  <value> </value>
  <description> Comma separated list of user and group names that are allowed
    to submit jobs to the 'default' queue. The user list and the group list
    are separated by a blank. For e.g. user1,user2 group1,group2. 
    If set to the special value '*', it means all users are allowed to 
    submit jobs. If set to ' '(i.e. space), no user will be allowed to submit
    jobs.

    It is only used if authorization is enabled in Map/Reduce by setting the
    configuration property mapred.acls.enabled to true.

    Irrespective of this ACL configuration, the user who started the cluster and
    cluster administrators configured via
    mapreduce.cluster.administrators can submit jobs.
