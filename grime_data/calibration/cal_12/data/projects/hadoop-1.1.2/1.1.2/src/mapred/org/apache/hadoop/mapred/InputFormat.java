/** 
 * <code>InputFormat</code> describes the input-specification for a 
 * Map-Reduce job. 
 * 
 * <p>The Map-Reduce framework relies on the <code>InputFormat</code> of the
 * job to:<p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>
 *   Validate the input-specification of the job. 
 *   <li>
 *   Split-up the input file(s) into logical {@link InputSplit}s, each of 
 *   which is then assigned to an individual {@link Mapper}.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *   Provide the {@link RecordReader} implementation to be used to glean
 *   input records from the logical <code>InputSplit</code> for processing by 
 *   the {@link Mapper}.
 *   </li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>The default behavior of file-based {@link InputFormat}s, typically 
 * sub-classes of {@link FileInputFormat}, is to split the 
 * input into <i>logical</i> {@link InputSplit}s based on the total size, in 
 * bytes, of the input files. However, the {@link FileSystem} blocksize of  
 * the input files is treated as an upper bound for input splits. A lower bound 
 * on the split size can be set via 
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../mapred-default.html#mapred.min.split.size">
 * mapred.min.split.size</a>.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Clearly, logical splits based on input-size is insufficient for many 
 * applications since record boundaries are to respected. In such cases, the
 * application has to also implement a {@link RecordReader} on whom lies the
 * responsibilty to respect record-boundaries and present a record-oriented
 * view of the logical <code>InputSplit</code> to the individual task.
