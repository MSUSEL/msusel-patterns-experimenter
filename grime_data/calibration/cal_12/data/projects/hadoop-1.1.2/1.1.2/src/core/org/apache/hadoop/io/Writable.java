 * A serializable object which implements a simple, efficient, serialization

 *
 * <p>Any <code>key</code> or <code>value</code> type in the Hadoop Map-Reduce
 * framework implements this interface.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Implementations typically implement a static <code>read(DataInput)</code>
 * method which constructs a new instance, calls {@link #readFields(DataInput)} 
 * and returns the instance.</p>
 *

 * <p><blockquote><pre>
 *     public class MyWritable implements Writable {
 *       // Some data     
 *       private int counter;
 *       private long timestamp;
 *

 *         out.writeLong(timestamp);

 *       public void readFields(DataInput in) throws IOException {
 *         counter = in.readInt();
