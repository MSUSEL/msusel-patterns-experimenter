#
# This is a readme for hadoop-version-dfs-dir.tgz and hadoop-dfs-dir.txt.
#
# See HADOOP-1629 for more info if needed.
# These two files are used by unit test TestDFSUpgradeFromImage.java 
# 
# hadoop-14-dfs-dir.tgz : 
# ---------------------
# This file contains the HDFS directory structure for one namenode and 4 datanodes.
# The structure is setup similar to the structure used in MiniDFSCluster.
# The directory was created with Hadoo-0.14.x.
#
# In the test, this directory is unpacked and MiniDFSCluster is run with 
# "-upgrade" option. The test waits for the upgrade to complete 
# (leave safe mode) and then all the files are read. The test checks that the
# directory structure and file checksums exactly match the information
# in this file.
#
# hadoop-dfs-dir.txt :
# ---------------------
# Along with this description this file contains the expected files and 
# checksums or the files in the upgraded DFS.
# 
# The original DFS directory was created with various types of files and with
# some recoverable errors (i.e. corrupt or missing .crc files).
#
# A similar set of files exist in two different DFS directories. 
# For e.g. "top-dir-1Mb-512" contains files created with dfs.block.size of 1Mb 
# and io.bytes.per.checksum of 512.
#
# In the future, when Hadoop project no longer supports upgrade from
# Hadoop-0.12, then a new DFS directory image must be created.
#
# To generate checksum info for new files :
# ---------------------------------------
# Uncomment the last coment (starts with "printChecksums") and run the 
# test again. When the test sees this line, it prints the checksum
# information that should replace the checksum information in 
# this file. When run in this mode, the test will fail with a descriptive IOException.
#
# Next, extract the checksum info from the test log like this:
#  sed -n 's/.*CRC info for reference file : //p' test-log.txt >> this_file
# This will append a new list of files and checksums to this file.  Be sure to remove the existing checksum info.
#
# For your reference, the format of the checksum info below is "filename whitespace*\twhitespace* checksum\n"
#
# Uncomment the following line to produce checksum info for a new DFS image.
#printChecksums
