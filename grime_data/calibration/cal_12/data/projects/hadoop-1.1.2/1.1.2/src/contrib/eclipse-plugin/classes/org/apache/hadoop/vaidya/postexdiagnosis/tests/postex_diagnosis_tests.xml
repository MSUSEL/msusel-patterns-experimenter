<!-- This is a diagnostic test configuration file. Diagnostic test driver 
     reads this file to get the list of tests and their configuration information
     
   Title            : Provides brief description of the test
   ClassName        : Provides the fully qualified java class name that implements the test condition
   Description      : Provides detailed information about the test describing how it checks for a specific
                        performance problem.
   SuccessThreshold : (value between [0..1])        
                    : Evaluation of a diagnostic test returns its level of impact on the job
                      performance. If impact value [between 0..1] is equal or greater than the 
                      success threshold, means rule has detected the problem (TEST POSITIVE) else 
                      rule has passed the test (TEST NEGATIVE). The impact level is calculated and 
                      returned by each test's evaluate method. For tests that are boolean in nature 
                      the impact level is either 0 or 1 and success threshold should be 1.
   Importance       : Indicates relative importance of this diagnostic test among the set of
                      diagnostic rules defined in this file. Three declarative values that
                      can be assigned are High, Medium or Low
   Prescription     : This is an optional element to store the advice to be included in the report upon test failure
                      This is overwritten in the report by any advice/prescription text returned by getPrescription method of 
                      DiagnosticTest.  
   InputElement     : Input element is made available to the diagnostic test for it to interpret and accept 
                      any parameters specific to the test. These test specific parameters are used to configure 
                      the tests without changing the java code.
