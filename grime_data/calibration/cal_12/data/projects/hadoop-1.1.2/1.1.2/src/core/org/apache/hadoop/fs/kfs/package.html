<h1>A client for the Kosmos filesystem (KFS)</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

This pages describes how to use Kosmos Filesystem 
(<a href="http://kosmosfs.sourceforge.net"> KFS </a>) as a backing
store with Hadoop.   This page assumes that you have downloaded the
KFS software and installed necessary binaries as outlined in the KFS
documentation.

<h3>Steps</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>In the Hadoop conf directory edit core-site.xml,
          add the following:
            <pre>
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;fs.kfs.impl&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;org.apache.hadoop.fs.kfs.KosmosFileSystem&lt;/value&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;The FileSystem for kfs: uris.&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
            </pre>

          <li>In the Hadoop conf directory edit core-site.xml,
          adding the following (with appropriate values for
          &lt;server&gt; and &lt;port&gt;):
            <pre>
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;fs.default.name&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;kfs://&lt;server:port&gt;&lt;/value&gt; 
&lt;/property&gt;

&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;fs.kfs.metaServerHost&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;&lt;server&gt;&lt;/value&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;The location of the KFS meta server.&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;

&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;fs.kfs.metaServerPort&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;&lt;port&gt;&lt;/value&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;The location of the meta server's port.&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;

</pre>
          </li>

          <li>Copy KFS's <i> kfs-0.1.jar </i> to Hadoop's lib directory.  This step
          enables Hadoop's to load the KFS specific modules.  Note
          that, kfs-0.1.jar was built when you compiled KFS source
          code.  This jar file contains code that calls KFS's client
          library code via JNI; the native code is in KFS's <i>
          libkfsClient.so </i> library.
          </li>

          <li> When the Hadoop map/reduce trackers start up, those
processes (on local as well as remote nodes) will now need to load
KFS's <i> libkfsClient.so </i> library.  To simplify this process, it is advisable to
store libkfsClient.so in an NFS accessible directory (similar to where
Hadoop binaries/scripts are stored); then, modify Hadoop's
conf/hadoop-env.sh adding the following line and providing suitable
value for &lt;path&gt;:
<pre>
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=&lt;path&gt;
</pre>


          <li>Start only the map/reduce trackers
          <br />
          example: execute Hadoop's bin/start-mapred.sh</li>
        </ul>
<br/>

If the map/reduce job trackers start up, all file-I/O is done to KFS.
