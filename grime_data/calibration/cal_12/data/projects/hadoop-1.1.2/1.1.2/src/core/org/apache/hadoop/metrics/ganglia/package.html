Implementation of the metrics package that sends metric data to 
<a href="http://ganglia.sourceforge.net/">Ganglia</a>.
Programmers should not normally need to use this package directly. Instead
they should use org.hadoop.metrics.

<p/>
These are the implementation specific factory attributes 
(See ContextFactory.getFactory()):

<dl>
    <dt><i>contextName</i>.servers</dt>
    <dd>Space and/or comma separated sequence of servers to which UDP
    messages should be sent.</dd>
    
    <dt><i>contextName</i>.period</dt>
    <dd>The period in seconds on which the metric data is sent to the
    server(s).</dd>
    
    <dt><i>contextName</i>.units.<i>recordName</i>.<i>metricName</i></dt>
    <dd>The units for the specified metric in the specified record.</dd>
    
    <dt><i>contextName</i>.slope.<i>recordName</i>.<i>metricName</i></dt>
    <dd>The slope for the specified metric in the specified record.</dd>
    
    <dt><i>contextName</i>.tmax.<i>recordName</i>.<i>metricName</i></dt>
    <dd>The tmax for the specified metric in the specified record.</dd>
    
    <dt><i>contextName</i>.dmax.<i>recordName</i>.<i>metricName</i></dt>
    <dd>The dmax for the specified metric in the specified record.</dd>
