    <section>
      <title>WebLogic 8.1</title>

      <para>This is the xdoclet version partly supported by JAG.
      Alle features of JAG can be used excluding Container Managed Relations.</para>

    <section>
      <title>WebLogic 8.1 EJBGen support</title>
      <para>WebLogic Workshop has default support for EJBGen, which is similar to xdoclet.
      With JAG it is now possible to generate a EJB module for WebLogic Workshop in EJBGen format.
      The generated source Can NOT be built with the ANT script. WebLogic Workshop is needed for that.
