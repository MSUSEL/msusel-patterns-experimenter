      <para>JBoss is the main application server supported by JAG. This
      document describes the requirements for using JBoss with JAG.</para>

    <section>
      <title>JBoss 3.0</title>

      <para>Full support with hot deploy. Set the appserver.deploy.dir in the
      .ant-global.properties and use ant to deploy the EAR.</para>

      <title>JBoss 3.2</title>

      <para>Full support with hot deploy. Difference with JBoss 3.0 are the
      datasource configuration files and the classloader. Set the
      appserver.deploy.dir in the .ant-global.properties and use ant to deploy
      the EAR.</para>

    <section>
      <title>JBoss 4.x</title>
      <para>Full support with hot deploy. Difference with JBoss 3.2 is that
      the commons-logging.jar is no longer distributed since it is already
      available with Jboss 4. Set the appserver.deploy.dir in the
      .ant-global.properties and use ant to deploy the EAR.</para>
