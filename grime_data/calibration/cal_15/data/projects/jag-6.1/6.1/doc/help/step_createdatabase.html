<h3>Creating the application database</h3>
<img src="images/datasource.jpg"><br>
To create a new application with JAG you will first need to create a database for the application.  The tables in this database will
determine the entities that you can create: unfortunately this isn't always the best way to design a database,
so this point is worth bearing in mind.
<p>
<b><i>TIP:</i></b> It makes sense to create foreign key definitions in your database tables if you intend to generate relations.
<p>
JAG does not provide any tools for creating a database; this is best done with your database's administration tools, or with a
generic database management application such as
<a href="http://www.minq.se/products/dbvis/!!!EXTERNAL!!!">DBVisualiser</a>,
<a href="http://squirrel-sql.sourceforge.net/!!!EXTERNAL!!!">SquirrelSQL</a>,
or <a href="http://www.quest.com/toad/!!!EXTERNAL!!!">Toad</a>.
<p>
Once the database has been created, you can specify the database connection by filling in the 'JDBC url' field
in the 'Datasource' configuration page (see following step).  JAG currently supports Oracle, MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.
