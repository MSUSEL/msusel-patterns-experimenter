When looking at the larger process of J2EE system development, application generation with JAG actually
comes as the <i>second</i> phase: first you must in some way define the system that you intend to build!
<p>
The first phase is the <b>design phase</b> referred to in the diagram above.  As far as JAG is concerned,
the output from this design phase is either a database model, or an object model.
<p>
<h4>Application generation from a database model</h4>
The process of generating an application from a database model with JAG breaks down into the following six steps:
<ol>
<li><a href="step_createdatabase.html">Creating the application database</a></li>
<li><a href="step_appconfig.html">Application configuration</a></li>
<li><a href="step_entity.html">Creating entities</a></li>
<li><a href="step_session.html">Creating services</a></li>
<li><a href="step_business.html">Creating business methods</a></li>
<li><a href="step_generate.html">Generating the application</a></li>
</ol>
<h4>Application generation from a UML model</h4>
Generating a J2EE application from a UML model (class diagram) is as simple as following these four steps:
<ol>
<li><a href="step_createumlmodel.html">Create the UML class diagram</a></li>
<li><a href="step_import_uml.html">Import the UML model into JAG</a></li>
<li><a href="step_appconfig.html">Application configuration</a></li>
<li><a href="step_generate.html">Generating the application</a></li>
</ol>
