    James is a multi-protocol message processing and storage engine. James
    currently consists of:

      <li> an NNTP server,</li>
      <li> a mail processing engine that supports the Mailet API</li>
      <li> file-system message storage and a message storage interface to RDBMS's</li>
      <li> file-system user record storage and an experimental interface to LDAP directories</li>
      <li> support for TLS (SSL) for POP3 and remote administration</li>
      <li> support for SMTP auth</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    James is built on top of Avalon, the Java Apache Server Framework.
    Versions 2.0 of James use a date-snapshot of Avalon code as of November 2001.
    The <code>lib</code> directory includes date-stamped jars of the various Avalon libraries.
    We intend to stay current with new versions of Avalon as they are released.</p>
