    <h1>StatusBar Examples</h1>
    <p>Here are several examples of using and customizing the Ext.StatusBar component.</p>
    <p>Note that the js is not minified so it is readable. See <a href="statusbar-demo.js">statusbar-demo.js</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Basic StatusBar</h2>
    <p>This is a simple StatusBar with a few standard Toolbar items included.</p>
    <div id="basic"></div>
    <p>

    <h2>Right-Aligned StatusBar</h2>
    <p>This is a simple StatusBar that has the status element right-aligned.  Any StatusBar items will be added in 
    exactly the same order on the left side of the bar.</p>
    <div id="right-aligned"></div>
    
    <h2>Status Window</h2>
    <p>You can add a StatusBar to a window in exactly the same way.</p>
    <div id="window" style="margin-bottom:20px;"></div>
    
    <h2>Customizing the Look and Feel</h2>
    <p>This is a standard StatusBar with some custom CSS styles applied and some event handling in place to
    handle the TextArea's keypress events.  Notice that after you've stopped typing for a few seconds a
    simulated auto-save process will begin.</p>
