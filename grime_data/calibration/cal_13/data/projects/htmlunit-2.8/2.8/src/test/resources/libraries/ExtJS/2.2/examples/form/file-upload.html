    <h1>File Upload Field</h1>
    <p>The example js is not minified so it is readable. See <a href="file-upload.js">file-upload.js</a>.  <a href='FileUploadField.js'>FileUploadField.js</a> is the custom extension used to create the file upload field.</p>


    <p>
        <b>Basic FileUpload</b><br />
        A typical file upload field with Ext style.  Direct editing of the text field cannot be done in a 
        consistent, cross-browser way, so it is always read-only in this implementation.
        <div id="fi-basic"></div>
        <div id="fi-basic-btn"></div>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Basic FileUpload (Button-only)</b><br />
        You can also render the file input as a button without the text field, with access to the field's value via the 
        standard <tt>Ext.form.TextField</tt> interface or by handling the <tt>fileselected</tt> event (as in this example).
        <div id="fi-button"></div>
        <div id="fi-button-msg" style="display:none;"></div>
        <div class="x-clear"></div>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Form Example</b><br />
        The FileUploadField can also be used in standard form layouts, with support for anchoring, validation (the
        field is required in this example), empty text, etc.  This example also demonstrates using the 
        <tt>buttonCfg</tt> option to provide a customized icon upload button.
        <div id="fi-form"></div>
