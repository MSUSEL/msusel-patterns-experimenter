<h1>History Example</h1>

<p>This is a simple implmenetation of the <tt>Ext.History</tt> component for managing browser back/forward navigation within a single page.</p>

<p>It demonstrates managing history for multiple components within the page. Simply change tabs and use the browser Back
and Forward buttons to navigate them.</p>

<p>The js is not minified so it is readable. See <a href="history.js">history.js</a>.</p>

<!-- Fields required for history management -->
<form id="history-form" class="x-hidden">
    <input type="hidden" id="x-history-field" />
    <iframe id="x-history-frame"></iframe>
</form>
