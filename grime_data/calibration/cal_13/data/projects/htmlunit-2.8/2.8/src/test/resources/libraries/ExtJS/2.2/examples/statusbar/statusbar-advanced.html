    <h1>Advanced StatusBar Example</h1>
    <p>This is an advanced example of customizing an Ext.StatusBar via a plugin.</p>
    <p>Note that the js is not minified so it is readable. See <a href="statusbar-advanced.js">statusbar-advanced.js</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Customizing the StatusBar</h2>
    <p>The <a href="ValidationStatus.js">ValidationStatus</a> plugin hooks into the StatusBar and automatically 
    monitors the validation status of any fields in the associated FormPanel.  Items of interest:</p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>The StatusBar syncs in real-time with the valid state of the form as you type</li>
        <li>When the form is invalid, the error status message can be clicked to hide/show a custom error list</li>
        <li>The error list items can be clicked to focus the associated fields</li>
        <li>After submitting successfully, note that the confirmation status message will fade out after 5 
        seconds and return to the default status (this is a config option)</li>
    </ul><br>
