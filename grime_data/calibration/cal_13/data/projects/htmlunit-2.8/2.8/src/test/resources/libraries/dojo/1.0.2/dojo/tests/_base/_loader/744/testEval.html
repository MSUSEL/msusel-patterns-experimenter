<p>
Defining global variables/functions in a module that is loaded via dojo.require()
(meaning that XHR is used to load the text of the file and then eval the text) does
not seem to define the global variables/functions on window.
</p>

<p>
The test succeeds if you see "It Worked" 3 times in the debug console, then a "Object's name is: light" message.
