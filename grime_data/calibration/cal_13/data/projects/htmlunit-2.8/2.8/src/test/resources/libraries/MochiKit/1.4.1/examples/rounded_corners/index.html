            This example demonstrates the rounded corners functionality of 
            <a href="http://mochikit.com">MochiKit</a>'s

        </p>
        <p>
            The heading at the top of this page should have all four corners
            rounded. The heading for this section should just have the bottom
            corners rounded.
