    <h1>Checkbox / Radio Groups</h1>
    <p>This demonstrates the flexible layout capabilities of the CheckboxGroup and RadioGroup classes. It also
    shows that you can validate checkboxes/radios as a group &mdash; try submitting the form before changing
    any values to see this.</p>
    <p>The js is not minified so it is readable. See <a href="check-radio.js">check-radio.js</a>.</p>
