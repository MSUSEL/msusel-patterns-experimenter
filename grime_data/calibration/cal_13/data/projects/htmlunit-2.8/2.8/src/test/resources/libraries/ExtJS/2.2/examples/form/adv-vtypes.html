<h1>Advanced Validation Examples Using VTypes</h1>

<div id="dr"><p>The first example shows two date fields acting as a date range.  Selecting an initial date
sets the minimum value for the end field.  Selecting an ending date sets a maximum value for the
start field.</p></div>

<div id="pw" style="padding-top:20px"><p>This second example shows a password verification,
 the second value must be equivalent to the first to validate.</p></div><br/>

<p>The js is not minified so it is readable. See <a href="adv-vtypes.js">adv-vtypes.js</a>.</p>
