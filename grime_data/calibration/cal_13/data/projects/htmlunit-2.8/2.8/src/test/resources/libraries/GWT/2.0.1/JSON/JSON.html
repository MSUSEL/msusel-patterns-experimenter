    <h1>JSON Interop Using JSNI</h1>
    
    <div class="intro">
      This example application demonstrates a simple approach to 
      interoperating with services that return their output in JSON format.
      It uses GWT's JavaScript Native Interface (JSNI) to analyze a JSON 
      response and create Java-accessible objects.  The JSON classes in this sample 
      are general-purpose and can be reused in other projects if you find 
      them useful.
      
      <p>
      When you click the "Search" button below, you can browse the cached 
      results of a Yahoo JSON image search for "potato."  The response is 
      parsed into Java objects which are used to populate a tree view below.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>For more details on how the JSON response is parsed into a set 
            of Java objects, see the JSONParser class.
        <li>The search URL used in this example was 
          <a href='http://api.search.yahoo.com/ImageSearchService/V1/imageSearch?appid=YahooDemo&amp;query=potato&amp;results=2&amp;output=json'>http://api.search.yahoo.com/ImageSearchService/V1/imageSearch?appid=YahooDemo&amp;query=potato&amp;results=2&amp;output=json</a>.
