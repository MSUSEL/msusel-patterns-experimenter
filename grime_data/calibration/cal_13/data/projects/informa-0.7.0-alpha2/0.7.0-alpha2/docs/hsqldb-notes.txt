Some notes about usage of HypersonicSQL (1.7.1)
It is a very nice database which can be run in 
standalone (server) or in-memory mode.

- export HSQLDB_HOME=/usr/local/java/hsqldb

- download and extract from hsqldb.sourceforge.net
  into HSQLDB_HOME

- export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$HSQLDB_HOME/lib/hsqldb.jar:.

$ java org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManager -?
Usage: java DatabaseManager [-options]
where options include:
    -driver <classname>  jdbc driver class
    -url <name>          jdbc url
    -user <name>         username used for connection
    -password <password> password for this user
    -dir <path>          default directory
    -script <file>       reads from script file

Example for url: jdbc:hsqldb:informa
default user: 'sa', default password: ''

$ java org.hsqldb.util.ScriptTool -script build/scripts/informa-hibernate.ddl -database informa

- Warning: Only INTEGER is allowed data type for IDENTITY columns,
  so the generated BIGINT (=> long id) definition is not working,
  workaround: manually changed the DDL
  TODO: investigate if this is resolved in a more current version of hsqldb
