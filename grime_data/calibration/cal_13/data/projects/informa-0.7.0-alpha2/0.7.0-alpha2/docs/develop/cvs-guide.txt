==================================================
Some notes about using CVS for the Informa project
--------------------------------------------------
(To make hopefully life easier and motivate usage
 of branches and tags wisely :-)
==================================================

Create a branch from the given release (server-side):
cvs rtag -r <release> -b <branch> informa

Checkout a specified release/branch into a named directory:
cvs -z3 -d:ext:<user>@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/informa co -r <release/branch> -d informa-0.4.5 informa

Checkout module informa (main trunk aka HEAD):
cvs -z3 -d:ext:<name>@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/informa co -d informa informa

Merge in difference between local revision and mentioned revision/branch:
cvs update -j <release/branck>

--
Should be used with care:
Delete a tag/branch name from CVS:
cvs rtag -d <branchname> informa
