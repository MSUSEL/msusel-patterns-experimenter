  <title>Available formats for this document</title>
  <simpara>This document is available in several formats.</simpara>
  <simpara>
      You may be reading this document right now at &distro_baseurl;, or in
      a distribution somewhere else.
      I hereby call the document distribution from which you are reading 
      this, your <emphasis>current distro</emphasis>.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
      &distro_baseurl; hosts the latest production versions of all available formats.
      If you want a different format of the same <emphasis>version</emphasis>
      of the document you are reading now, then you should try your
      current distro.
      If you want the latest production version, you should try &distro_baseurl;.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
      Sometimes, distributions other than &distro_baseurl; do not host all
      available formats.
      So, if you can't access the format that you want in your current
      distro, you have no choice but to use the newest production version at 
      &distro_baseurl;.
