# Sample HyperSQL Network Listener ACL file.
# Specify "allow" and "deny" rules
# For address specifications, individual addresses, host names, and
# network addresses with /bit suffix are allowed, but read the caveat about
# host names below, under the sample "localhost" rule.

# Blank lines ignored.
   # Lines with # as the first non-whitespace character are ignored.


allow 2001:db8::/32
# Allow this 32-bit ipv4 subnet

allow localhost
# You should use numerical addresses in ACL files, unless you are certain that
# the name will always be known to your network address resolution system
# (assume that you will lose Internet connectivity at some time).
# With a default name resolution setup on UNIX, you are safe to use names
# defined in your /etc/hosts file.

deny 192.168.101.253
# Deny a single IP address.
# In our example, 192.168.101.0/24 is our local, organizational network.
# 192.168.101.253 is the IP address of our Intern's PC.
# The Intern does not have permission to access our databases directly.

allow 192.168.101.0/24

# Any ipv4 or ipv6 candidate address not matched above will be denied
